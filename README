lizardcheck: a filter that checks for files with chunks with
badly-replicated chunks.

Usage:

# list all critically-endangered files, i.e. with chunks with exactly one copy
find /mnt/lizard -type f -print0 | lizardcheck -n 0 -zb

# delete all files with missing chunks
find /mnt/lizard -type f -print0 | lizardcheck -n 0 -zZ | xargs -0r rm -f
